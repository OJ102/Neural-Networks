# Neural-Networks
Here I build a neural network from scratch to identify a flowerâ€™s color given a dataset with known flower with their length and width.
This project was built to gain a deeper understanding of neural networks
default hyperparameters: learning rate = 0.5; Training loop runs= 50,000
